#Used online videos for most of my Solidity/Blockchain/Ethereum notes: 

## ** Bitcoin for Beginners notes: **

Good Book to Read: Mastering Bitcoin & The Internet of Money

You can download the whitepaper from bitcoin.org 

### Bitcoin & it's network: 
  -system of electronic cash
  -(random mesh network) peer to peer
  -white paper implemented in software
  -it can be run on your computer.

** NOBODY CONTROLS BITCOIN’S NETWORK (DECENTRALIZED) **

you know whose making the transactions through their digital signatures. the entire network knows that transactions have occurred due to digital signatures (No ID, or personal info is required for a transaction)

In bitcoin a software agent, not owned by anyone through cryptography can interact , own and use bitcoin for transactions internationally 

** Suggest Downloading Bitcoin Wallet and trying it out(Buy a satoshi) **

  -The cost of doing a transaction, every time is a $1
  -Blockchain: global transaction ledger
  -Proof of work: allows security on the blockchain (decentralized consensus method)
  -Open border system(only thing that matters is if the transaction is valid)
  -Bitcoin: replaced of trusts through institutions to trust through networks

## Introducing the Bitcoin:

What determines the buying power of a company? 
everyone determines this 

Bitcoin trading never ceases (no closing price)its a rolling average. Its not like stocks that stop being traded at closing bell, there is not closing bell for Bitcoin. 

As the volumes goes up, transactions go up, and volatility drops, but know this that volatility is relative

Its very difficult to hack people through bitcoin, and yes sure we've created a honey pot to attract all of the biggest hackers in the world, but that only makes it stronger. 

### BITCOIN:
  + largest cryptographic deployment in world
  + large public key infrastructure in the world
  + largest honey pot in the world
  + it generate immunity by being attacked all the time by the worlds best hackers. 

The supply of bitcoin is determined algorithmically based on geometrically declining bitcoin function and every year there is a half of the amount of bitcoins created, less and less is issued over time. 

2141 is when bitcoin is done being created (21 million coins is the asymptotic cap)

### How Bitcoin works under the hood?

Bitcoin: digital file that lists account and values it holds

The ledger is maintained by a group(anonymous group), no single entity, and no trust is needed to work with bitcoin.

There is a digital signature that is required for every transaction. 

private key -> message -> signature -> message -> public key

Look up diffe-hellman encryption color codes and clock algorithm, theres some wonderful Youtube clips. 

When you send someone money you send it to their public key, never there private key! YOU SHOULD NEVER EVER EVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEY WITH SOMEONE! 

Ecdsa(elliptic curve digital signature algorithm) is a variant of digital Signature Algorithim. Know this for the future in case you get asked about it. 

To verify values/balances people have then they verify the transactions that have happened in the past.

Validity of each transaction is dependent on previous transaction. (check validity all the way back)

Transaction List exists not really a ledger, and Outputs are more like puzzles to be solved.

You can create unlimited public keys, but only 1 private key per account, if you want to switch accounts then you will have a different public key and a different private key. Public key creation ( sending/receiving address) completely anonymous

### Bitcoin Transaction Security:
  	1. Digital Signatures
	2. Referenced Transactions

Transaction Order, no guarantee that an order that they are received is the order they were created. The time stamp could be fake, never trust bob. Theres no way to prove which transaction came first HENCE THE BLOCKCHAIN was created. 

The network picks where blocks will go through the answers of complex math problem., aka cryptographic hash. To find a particular output value you must guess, it would take a computer years to solve one block. 

The cryptographic hash locks blocks in place, hash output identifies what is stored in the block. Theres no way to switch a block in a chain, a block cannot be solved without a previous block solved. 

Transaction order is protected by a race:
    Find x such that f(block + x) < target (cryptographic hash)

Time attacker must outpace or “out luck” the network, and less time the transaction has happened, means less secure, more time means more secure. 

Proof of work: finding solutions is hard, checking solutions are easy. 

Coins get into the ownership chain through solving a block aka mining, 

            0.00000001 BC aka a satoshi

Transactions will be processed through fees attached in the future (maybe now).

Mining pools collectively work to solve problems, and gain rewards. 

bitcoin is faster for merchants

more power solves faster.

## Summary:

### Bitcoin:
	-digital Signatures, safe guard money
	-transaction chains, store history of ownership
	- block chain , holds transaction order
	-gov meddling is no no
	-anonymity
	- lower global transaction fees
	- used for illegal activity
	- difficult to exchange
	- mining/solving blocks uses a large amount of energy
