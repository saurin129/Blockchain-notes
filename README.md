# Blockchain-notes


These are a lot of my notes and codes from working with the Blockchain, and Ethereum. No private information is on this, and all of this can be found easily on the internet. If you are currently one of the interns who I work with this is a great start to learning about solidity, Ethereum and of course the blockchain!


Also if you work for Blockchain Technologies Corp, our github is separate, however anyone is free to check out the public code I've put up there or anything that anyone else has written in the company.
